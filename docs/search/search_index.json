It is the most popular version control system among professional programmers,  and this tutorial aims to making it understandable and usable by non-programmers.</p> <p>Git can be used both from the command-line interface (a.k.a. <code>cmd</code> under windows) or via a graphical user interface. This page describes the operations that Git can execute, independently from the type of interface and refers to other pages for  the CLI and GUI way of doing it.</p>"},{"location":"#lets-get-started-init","title":"Let's get started: <code>init</code>","text":"<p>Say that you have a folder <code>MyProject</code> containing some files (or empty) and you want to start  version-controlling it with git.

You run a <code>git commit</code> operation and git will make a copy of your working directory and give it a name for you.
